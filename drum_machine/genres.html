					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip-hop music, also rap music, is a genre consisting of a stylized rhythmic structure that commonly
					accompanies rapping; a rhythmic speech that is chanted. It developed as part of the hip-hop culture and is also its own subculture defined
					by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing and Graffiti writing. Other elements are also sampling 
					(or synthesis), and beat boxing. While often used to refer to rapping “hip-hop” more properly denotes the practice of the entire culture. 
					The term hip-hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip-hop music; 
					the genre may also incorporate other elements of the culture including beat boxing, DJing, and scratching as listed before.</p>
					<p>Hip-hop as a music and culture formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly
					among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables to 
					extend the breaks. Hip-hop’s early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum-Machines became widely available and affordable.
					Turntable techniques developed to make the music longer and more rhythmically complex. This eventually evolved in to adding lyrics or what 
					is known as rapping; a vocal style in which the artist speaks along with an instrumental or synthesized beat; which is taken from the
					Jamaican toasting vocal style.<sup>1</sup> This was used to express oneself in a song or series of sequences. The 1980s marked the diversification of 
					hip-hop as the genre developed more complex styles. Prior to that, hip-hop was largely confined to the U.S. However during the early 1980s
					it began its spread and became a part of the music scene across the world.</p>

					<center><p><b><u>Kool DJ Herc</u></b></p></center>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kool DJ Herc is considered the originator of the “break beat” DJing. By isolating and repeating the “breaks”, or most danceable parts,
					or funk record by names like Mandrill. James Brown, and the Jimmy Castor Bunch, Herc created the prototype for modern day hip-hop. Others 
					such as Grand Master Flash perfected and elevated the technique, but it was Herc who is credited for its creation. Beginning his DJing 
					career in the early 70s Her immediately distinguished himself by spinning late 60s funk records and isolating their breaks. Among other 
					things, Her was notorious for throwing all-night parties with his own sound system, which was reported to be capable of overtaking a
					partygoer’s body. With these block and all night parties, Herc also instigated a sub culture to Hip-hop, which is known as break dancing. 
					In the 1970s the dancing evolved into the early incarnation of break dancing, young dancers known as B-boys sparked this interest and it 
					has now become a type of modern dance.<sup>2</sup> Herc’s career was sidelined, when he was stabbed at one of his parties, causing him to curb his 
					activities for several years. In later years he would appear now and again to talk about his hip-hop career and the early days. But Herc
					drifted away from the hip-hop community and ceases to be a key player like he <strike>was in the early 70’s.<sup>3</sup></strike></p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N.W.A (an abbreviation of Niggaz Wit Attitudes) was an American Hip-Hop group from Compton, California.<sup>4</sup>
					Widely considered one of the seminal acts of the gangster rap and west coast Hip-Hop sub-genres. They were credited as the most important
					group in the history of rap music. Active from 1986 to 1991.<sup>5</sup> The rap group endured controversy due to explicit lyrics that many considered
					to be disrespectful to women, and glorifying drugs and crime. The group was subsequently band from many mainstream American radio stations.
					In spite of this, the group as sold over 10 million units in the United States alone.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in 1969 and raised in the rough Marcy Projects of Brooklyn, New York, Jay-Z underwent some ought 
					times after his father left his mother before the young rapper was even a teen. Without a man in the house, he became a self-supportive
					youth, turning to the streets, were he began his career in dealing drugs. At around the same time he met the East Coast rapper Jonathan
					Burks, who went by the name Jaz-O. In 1989, Jaz-O recorded a song called "The Originators," which featured one of young Jay-Z’s earliest
					verses. Though the similarities between their stage names are striking, Jay insists the resemblance is coincidental, and that his name is 
					a re-working of his childhood nickname "Jazzy." In later interviews, Jay would describe himself as a "reluctant rapper," focusing mainly
					on the more lucrative occupation of selling drugs.<sup>6</sup> In 1996 his attentions began to shift, he and two friends, Damon Dash and Kareem Burke.
					They formed the group Roc- A-fella Records ands that issued Jay-Z’s debut with the record Reasonable Doubt. With the success of his music, 
					Jay-Z became one of the fastest growing Hop-Hop artists in the country. In 2003 Jay-Z announced his new album The Black Album. This release
					came with the surprise announcement that “There will be no more full-length Jay-Z albums.”<sup>7</sup> In 2005 his interests shifted from performing
					to presenting and accepted a position with record label Def Jam. With his newest album debuting in 2009 The Blueprint 3, Jay-Z found himself
					back on the performing side of music. With the album producing the number one single “Empire State of Mind”. With that album he contracted
					himself with LiveNation, which virtually ended his retirement for the foreseeable future.</p>

					<center><p><b><u>Rock</u></b></p></center>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music we know as rock and roll emerged in the mid 1950’s, although it had been on the horizon for at 
					least a decade. A quarter of the American population moved during World War II, and that brought southern, rural, sacred and secular 
					traditions into new contact with urban-based music and audiences. The product of many regional musical scenes and independent record
					labels, rock and roll emerged in Memphis, Los Angeles, Shreveport, New York, Detroit, Baltimore, and dozens of other cities. It was, in 
					historian Charlie Gillett’s words, “The sound of the City”<sup>1</sup>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and roll drew on many different styles. Combining the boogie-woogie, rhythms of R&B, the hillbilly
					twang of country, the fever of gospel and the moans of the blues, the new mongrel music exited a worldwide generation of young listeners
					while upsetting established social cultural and musical authorities. The charisma and musical bravado of early rock and roll heroes such 
					as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard inspired fans and young musicians alike. With the maturing of an unprecedented vast and
					affluent teenage audience, rock and roll music became the sound of young America and soon spread around the world.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rock and Roll became more popular, artists started getting creative. Adding new instruments, and 
					different types of sub culture influences. One sub genre of rock is glam rock. Glam rock origins are associated with Marc Bolan. His band
					the T.Rex had originally played folk music, but with the popularity and growth of electronic instruments he reinvented his band by the end
					of the 60’s. Glam rock was made out of the English psychedelic and art frock sense of the late 60;s and can be seen as an extension and a
					reaction to that time. A mixture of 1930’s Hollywood glamour, added 1950’s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary
					and symbolism, science fiction, to ancient and occult spiritualism, with outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles and platform- soled boots.
					Gam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny besides extensive use of theatrics. <br />Below are some 
					links to examples of this style of music.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtBrsdfnhs"><b>Marc Bolan and the T.Rex</b></a></p>
					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o--0G4kxFY"><b>Kiss</b></a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychedelic Rock was the worlds LSD inspired genre. The first group to advertise themselves as
					psychedelic rock was the 13th floor Elevators from Texas at the end of 1965. The Beatles introduced many of the major elements of the 
					psychedelic sound to audiences as well. The popularity of this style of rock took off in California’s emerging music industry. Music
					critics blame psychedelic rock for the drug culture commonly associated with rock music. Other artists of this genre are Jimi Hendrix and 
					The Rolling Stones.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another form of rock emerging in the 1960’s is jazz-rock with its influence of progressive rock with the
					musical complexity and improvisation elements of jazz Many early US rock musicians had begun their interests in music with jazz and 
					carried some of their past learning’s to this new music. Unfortunately this sub-genre was short lived as in the early 1970’s as mellower 
					fusion music took the audience away from jazz-rock. But not before the likes of Frank Zappa and Joni Mitchell could record some of the 
					most significant albums of this period. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2b0OIkTraI"><b>Frank Zappa</b></a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop-rock and power-pop are terms that have been used to describe a more commercially successful music 
					that uses elements from, or the form of rock music. Pop rock has been identified as an upbeat variety of rock music. Artists that are 
					known for this style are Elton John, Paul McCartney and The Everly Brothers. It is also known to be a subgenre of pop music as well. With 
					its catchy rifts that are mostly guitar based and lyrics that are easy to remember. Artists such as The Red Hot Chili Peppers and AC/DC are
					most popular for this style of Pop with Rock influence and Instruments.</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"><b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b></a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years rock as a genre has grown and expanded to many different genres and therefore transforming
					the music all together. With so many listeners still appreciating the origins of rock to artists creating their own kind of rock it is no
					wonder that rock is one of the most widespread genres in the world today. With the continued creation of all different types of music it 
					is hard to know where it will go next.Traditional Mexican Music</p>
					<br />
					<center><p><b><u>Traditional Mexican Music</u></b></p></center>	
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is a very important part of Mexican Culture. It has always been apart of celebration, whether big 
					or small. The music of Mexico sings of love, country, passion, history, legend and oppression. Some popular genres of traditional Mexican
					music are Mariachi, Ranchera, and Norteño (Grupero).</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets start with Mariachi. Mariachi music is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Mexican 
					music. The term Mariachi is thought to derive from the French term “marriage” which translates to marriage. As you can suspect this music 
					was often played at weddings. Mariachis also play at quinceañeras; a celebration held at girls 15th birthday, on mother’s day, and also 
					often used to serenade women on their birthdays. A Mariachi band usually is composed of violins, trumpets and a classical guitar what’s 
					called Vihuela, which is a guitar with five strings. Musicians wear the traditional silver studded Charro suit, including a sombrero. This
					music originated in the state of Jalisco in the 19th century<sup>1</sup>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the Rachera, this traditional music takes from old folklore and is mostly about love, 
					patriotism or nature. The word Ranchera was taken from the word rancho because the music originated on the ranches of rural Mexico. It’s 
					said to be born from the new national consciousness during the Mexican revolution in reaction to the aristocratic tastes of the era.
					Rancheras are varied and can reflect the style of the waltz, polka or even a bolero<sup>2</sup>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly the Norteño; named for its Mexican birthplace and more formally called “la musica norteña”.
					It is a small group dance, danced to a band consisting of an accordion and bajo sexto. Norteño being mostly for dance oriented events and 
					gatherings, was also known for its historical role as the music for the working classes, its celebratory exuberance and often tough,
					raucous lyrics setting it apart to other styles of music. The traditional ensemble includes an accordion (simple diatonic), bajo sexto 
					(a baritone range twelve-tone string guitar), bass, and drums. Also in the band were two very expressive singers that would put all the
					passion into the lyrics. The format of the style settled in the 1950’s but it dates back to the late 1800’s, when the Mexican people were
					introduced to the accordion<sup>3</sup>. Various European dances such as the polka, waltz influenced the music and the dance that went with it. The
					Norteño can provide a variety of song forms and rhythms, but its dominant role was a corrido or story song preformed over a polka or waltz
					rhythm. In the 1960’s the exploration of the music’s capacity expanded greatly bringing it to new heights. In the following years 
					norteño/conjunto was the most popular style of music among Mexican working classes in Texas and northern Mexico.</p>

					<center><p><b><u>The Waltz</u></b></p></center>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Waltz is the oldest of the ballroom dances, dating from the middle of the Eighteenth Century. The
					German “Lander”, a folk dance, is supposed to the forerunner of the Waltz.<sup>1</sup> During this time period a dance developed which was called the
					“Waltzer”, a word owing its origin to the Latin word Volvere, which indicates a rotating motion. It’s danced in a moderately fast triple
					meter, in which the dancers take one step to each beat.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waltz reflected some of the most basic values that changed late 18th century Europe, ideals of 
					liberty, expression, freedom. The popularity of this dance and music spread throughout the world and inspired its leading musicians:
					Beethoven, Mozart, Hayden, and especially Strauss, to compose more of such music. Europe fell in love with waltzes.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Lanner (1801-1843) was an Austrian dance music composer.<sup>2</sup>He is best remembers as one of the
					earliest Viennese composers to reform the waltz from a simple peasant dance to something that even the highest society could enjoy. He was
					just as famous as his friend and musical rival Johann Strauss I, who was better known outside of Austria in their day because of his
					concert tours abroad, in particular to France and England.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johann Strauss II (October 25<sup>th</sup>, 1825-June 3,1899) was an Austrian composer of light music,
					particular dance music and operettas. He composed over 400 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music. Johann II 
					developed the classical Viennese Waltz to the point where it became as much a feature of the concert hall as the dance floor.<sup>3</sup> In his 
					lifetime, he was known as “The Waltz King”, and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz dance during the 19th
					century.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waltz made its way across the Atlantic sooner rather than later. Influencing the late 19<sup>th</sup> 
					century Mexican high society. In the late 19th century the waltz became a cultural emblem of Mexico. Like the other genres such as the polka,
					the waltz was adopted and transformed to reflected Mexico’s vitality and sensitivity. It became one of the most popular forms of ballroom
					dancing with its light beat and brilliant melodies and became the one of the panicle genres of dance and song of high society; specifically
					the Porfirio Diaz Era (1876-1911)<sup>4</sup>. The waltz is also heard in all styles of traditional and popular Mexican music including mariachi, 
					norteño and banda styles.</p>
